# Image Generation with GAN

This folder contains a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) implementation from scratch designed to recreate images from the digits dataset. The program demonstrates the power of GANs in generating high-quality images and emphasizes that the more you train the model, the better the results become.

## Features

- **Image Generation**: Generate realistic images from a dataset.
- **Training Process**: The program showcases improvements over time, with results becoming clearer and more refined as training progresses.
- **Performance**: The model achieved significant results after only **23 epochs**, illustrating the effectiveness of the GAN architecture.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizing results)
